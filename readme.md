# Build with
- React 16
- Typescript 2+
- Webpack 3+ for bundling
- paths resolving (in webpack and typescript)
- MobX
- Dependency injection (inversify): property injection for Stores in React components
- axios for http
- json-server for tests

# Problems
- types for events are not working, but definitions seems to be fine
- why TYPES can not be exported from IoC.ts ?!?!? their must be in separete file..
